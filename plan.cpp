load in audio file
set to mono if originally stereo
create array of doubles containing input bits
apply fft to array
identify frequency components
output file containing:
    frequencies (and therefore the note)
    duration (and therefore duration of note)
    amplitude (and therefore dynamics?) STRETCH GOAL
    time of note


input settings:
    key signature?
    time signature?

frequencies:
    a
    b
    c
    d
    e
    f
    g
    including sharps/flats
    A sharp = B flat
    E sharp = F natural
